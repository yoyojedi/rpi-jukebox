What is this?
=============

[Jeremy Lightsmith](https://github.com/jeremylightsmith)'s wife is a Montessori teacher, and didn't want screens to be a part of his life until 6 years old. I wanted him to be able to choose his own music and play it as much as he wanted. This jukebox lets him do that without screens.

He just holds the card with the picture of the song/album near the jukebox and it starts playing...

Magic!

Installation
============

Setup WiFi
----------

According to [this](https://techblog.willshouse.com/2013/06/11/solved-raspbian-with-edimax-ew-7811un-wifi-adapter-and-802-1x-authentication/)

You should now be able to ssh into your raspberry pi.

Preparing your music
--------------------

The structure for the USB Flash Drive is:

    music/
        1-my song.mp3
        2-my other song.mp3
        3-my album/
            first album song.mp3
            second album song.mp3
    sounds/
        i_am_listening.mp3
        repeating_on.mp3
        repeating_off.mp3
    cards.txt

You can copy the sounds directory from this repository. And the cards.txt file will get generated for you.

You have to populate with music directory. All that's important is that every file or directory starts with a distinct number then dash.

-------------------------

create the mount

    cd /mnt
    sudo mkdir bigdaddy
